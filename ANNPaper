Searches negatively impacted by glitches 
	- Affect search stats
	- Removed manually before offline analysis 
Use iDQ to identify glitches in low-latency
	- Overview of iDQ
	- iDQ algorithms correlate safe aux channel activity with gw channel glitches
Discuss ANN 
	- OVL(?)/MVSC(?)
ANN as good as MVSC/OVL
Feature set expansion
	- Original features 
	- New features
Random feature
	- Adding info didn't work, try taking it away
	- ANN does just as well
Effect of higher gw channel threshold
	- Higher efficiencies
	- But finding essentially the same glitches
Effect of different network architectures
	- Size/depth of network has no effect on performance
