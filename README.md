# Research
I conduct physics research at Kenyon College as a member of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration.  LIGO’s groundbreaking observation of the collision of two neutron stars in August 2017, and the immediate follow-up observation of the electromagnetic radiation from the event, ushered in a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. Dual observations such as this will allow for rigorous tests of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity and are expected to provide answers to outstanding questions about the structure of astrophysical bodies and of the universe itself.  Future multi-messenger observations will depend on the efficacy of LIGO’s low-latency (near real-time) searches for gravitational waves.  These searches are negatively affected by the presence of transient noise artifacts, known as glitches, in the data.  Efficient glitch identification and removal will improve the speed and accuracy with which LIGO is able to communicate a detection to EM telescopes for follow up. Machine learning algorithms (MLA’s) have shown great potential for identifying glitches in near real-time, and will be implemented in LIGO’s 3rd observing run.  My research involves optimizing the performance of an artificial neural network, as well as the novel application of a recurrent neural network to this problem.  This repository houses some of the code that I have written over the course of this project.
